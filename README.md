# Module 12 Challenge: UFO Sightings - JavaScript
## by Crystina Dang

### Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this challenge was to assist Dana and her followers in reducing down the dynamic table to specified inputs using filters.

### Results: 

**How to use:**
1. Scroll down the page to *"Filter Search"*
2. Below, input in at least one field (ensure the Date is in the suggested format and all other fields are in lowercase)
3. Data should be displayed to the right

*Below is an image of the available filters to the left and a sample of all the data presented when the filters are not used:*

*Below is an image of a few inputs to the left and a sample of the reduced data:*

The two above images show the dynamic table and the filters functioning.

### Summary:
A drawback of the new design compared to the single button is that the user may not be aware of the complete table when the fields are empty, as well as that the inputs will only be entered unless a non-typing action is made. There are several accessibility issues with this webpage that could be rectified with additional contrast, colour, or prompts. The table is not made without a boundary and contrast and colour could support the user in dividing their attention. Additional prompts could also be considered to support users in understanding the actions that are being made.
